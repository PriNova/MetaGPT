<h2 align="center">🤖 AI-Powered Multi-Agent System</h2>
<p></p>
Welcome to our AI-powered multi-agent system! This project aims to help users streamline processes and automate repetitive tasks using a combination of NLP and multi-agent systems. We've designed a modular and scalable architecture that allows for easy extensibility and adaptability. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or leave some feedback!
