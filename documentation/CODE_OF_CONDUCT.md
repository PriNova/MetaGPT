# Code of Conduct

This document outlines the code writing style and paradigm that contributors should follow when working on this project. Adhering to these guidelines ensures a consistent, maintainable, and professional codebase.

## General Principles

- Write clean, modular, and well-organized code.
- Follow best practices for Python programming.
- Optimize for readability and maintainability.
- Prioritize data-oriented programming and onion architecture principles.
- Write detailed and clear documentation for all functions, classes, and modules.

## Code Organization

1. **Organize code into modules and packages**: Separate different aspects of the application into distinct modules and packages to promote modularity and scalability.

2. **Group related functions and classes**: Keep related functions and classes together within the same module or package.

3. **Separate data and functions/operations**: Classes should only contain data, and functions should be implemented separately to operate on these data models.

## Code Style

1. **Follow PEP 8**: Adhere to the [PEP 8 style guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code.

2. **Use clear and descriptive variable and function names**: Choose variable and function names that clearly indicate their purpose and improve code readability.

3. **Use appropriate data structures**: Choose the most appropriate data structures for your specific use case to optimize performance and readability.

4. **Keep functions small and focused**: Functions should have a single responsibility and be limited in size to improve readability and maintainability.

5. **Error handling**: Gracefully handle errors and exceptions, providing informative error messages where appropriate.

## Testing and Documentation

1. **Write unit tests**: Write unit tests for your pure functions to ensure their correctness.

2. **Keep documentation up to date**: Ensure that the documentation remains accurate and up-to-date as the codebase evolves.

## Version Control

1. **Write clear and concise commit messages**: Craft commit messages that provide a clear and concise summary of the changes made.

2. **Organize commits logically**: Group related changes into single commits and use branches to separate different features or bug fixes.

By following this code of conduct, contributors will help maintain a high-quality, consistent, and professional codebase that is easy to understand and modify.
